This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Lua related to the `pairs` iterator. When a table is modified during iteration using `pairs`, the iteration may not behave as expected. The `bug.lua` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.lua` provides a solution using a safer approach.  The issue stems from the fact that `pairs` iterates based on the table's internal structure, which can be altered during the loop. Modifying the table while iterating can lead to elements being skipped or visited multiple times. The solution involves creating a copy of the table before iteration.
